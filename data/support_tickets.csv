I can't see my rides detailed (see picture), but other atletes rides I can see.
The problem is with Windows RT OS and it came up today. There is no problem with this feature when using Windows 10 machine.

This is first time when this has been happened.
I attached my training data from flow.polar.com."

I don't want to give my credit card details.
I am disappointed you have't offer Windows Phone-version.
For example Endomondo and Sports Tracker has WP-version and you not, why?

If you would offer a WP-version, I would like to pay for Premium."

176265,"Nov 12, 2013, 7:52:51 PM","Have you any plan to develop the program that you can import data of the ruoute for a base of new route or 
copy selected route as a new route with different name so you can edit it as a new route.
So you don't have to plan the route from the beginning if it mostly is a route you have before planned and saved."
